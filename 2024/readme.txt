my solutions for the 2024 Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/2024

================================================================================

using the ../2023/aoc2023.exe runner from previous year

run "build.bat" and it compiles and spouts all solutions

run "build.bat /DEBUG" to make aoc2023.exe wait before running each solution,
this is useful to attach a debugger to the waiting process to debug the dll.

run "build.bat /BENCH" to make aoc2023.exe run the solutions multiple times,
to get an average timing over 500 iterations.
